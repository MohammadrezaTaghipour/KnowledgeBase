# Feature

Feature is Gherkin’s word for indicating that a new specification has begun—what follows is the name of the feature being documented. 
Conventionally, every feature file consists of a single Feature in order to encourage writing many small files rather than a few large specifications.

    Feature: Scheduling

</br>

Below the Feature line, you can add a **description** of the feature. It’s expected to describe the business value of this feature or to provide additional information that makes the feature easier to understand.

   
    Feature: Scheduling
    
      Because scheduling is a huge functionality, this specification file describes only the most important
      high-level scenario.
      You can find more detailed scenarios in the rest of the files inside the "meetings" folder in the specification suite.
