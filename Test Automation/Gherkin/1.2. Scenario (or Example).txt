# Scenario

We know that Gherkin captures behavioral requirements. Behavioral requirements are formed as stories about how users behave when they interact with the system. In Gherkin, these stories are called _scenarios_.

    Feature: Scheduling
      Because scheduling is a huge functionality, this 
      specification file describes only the most important 
      high-level scenario. 
      You can find more detailed scenarios in the rest 
      of the files inside the "meetings" folder in the specification suite.

The keyword **Scenario** is a synonym of the keyword **Example**.

Every scenario should do the following:

- Define context (the _Givens_)
- Describe an event that occurs within the system (the _Whens_)
- Ensure that expected outcomes take place (the _Thens_)

The sequence is called the Given-When-Then template.

The _Givens_ explain what needs to happen so you can watch the rest of the scenario take place. The Whens neatly organize the template around a single behavior of the system, so a reader doesnâ€™t have to wonder what the purpose of the _scenario_ is. The _Thens_ clarify the consequences of taking that action.
